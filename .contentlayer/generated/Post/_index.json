Refs in React are a powerful tool but they can be tricky and can be misused easily which can lead to lots of bugs and unexpected behaviours. we will go through most of the ways we can utilize the Refs for good**\n\nYou can read more about `useRef` hook in [react docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref). \n\nRefs are simply references to something. like a **DOM element** or a **javascript value**. We use `useRef` hook to access a ref.\n```tsx\nfunction  useRef<T>(initialValue: T): MutableRefObject<T>;\n```\n `useRef` takes an initial value and returns a mutable ref object which has `current` value.\nThis returned object will persist throught the lifecycle of the component and through all of its re-renders until it unmounts.\n\n```tsx\nconst ref = useRef(1);\nconsole.log(ref);\n// ref => {current: 1}\n\n// we can mutate the current value\nref.current = 5;\nconsole.log(ref);\n// ref => {current: 5}\n```\n\nSome of the common usecases of refs\n- Creating mutable instance-like variables for functional components which would not trigger re-render on updates.\n-  Accessing DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.\n\n\n\nNote: \n- Changing the value of a ref doesn't trigger a re-render.\n-  It is useless to add a ref in the dependency array of useEffect or the other hooks since they would not update the React State.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Some demo examples</summary>\n  \n  1.  **Changing the value of a ref doesn't trigger a re-render.**\n  \n  ```tsx\n  import { useRef } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  // create a ref\n  const counter = useRef(0);\n\n  // increase the counter by one\n  const handleIncrease = () => {\n    counter.current = counter.current + 1;\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Value: {counter.current}</h2>\n      <button onClick={handleIncrease}>\n        Increase count\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n  ```\n\n[Try the demo by yourself](https://codesandbox.io/s/voyage-sea-i58vom-i58vom?file=/src/App.js)\n\n  here  clicking the increase count button does not update the value in the DOM since there are no re-renders.\n- For the DOM to update, the corresponding component has to re-render to get the UI in sync with the updated React state.\n[here is an article I found useful on this topic](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/why-react-re-renders/)\n  \n  using useState hook would be appropriate here in this scenario because it changes the state triggering a re-render\n\n2. **It is useless to add a ref in the dependency array of useEffect or the other hooks**\n\n```tsx\n  import { useRef, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  // create a ref\n  const counter = useRef(0);\n\n  useEffect(()=> {\n\tconsole.log(`count changed to: `, counter.current)\t\n  }, [counter])\n\n  // increase the counter by one\n  const handleIncrease = () => {\n    counter.current = counter.current + 1;\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Value: {counter.current}</h2>\n      <button onClick={handleIncrease}>\n        Increase count\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n[Try the demo by yourself](https://codesandbox.io/s/adoring-mayer-8vib0k?file=/src/App.js)\n\nIntended thing here is to log the value of count everytime the count value updates. but nothing will happen here since the state won't update and we don't get any logging in the console. see the demo codesandbox for the live demo.\n  \n</details>\n\n## Accessing DOM elements with ref\n\n```tsx\nimport {useRef,useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction AccessingElement() {\nconst elementRef = useRef();\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\tconst DomElement = elementRef.current;\n\tconsole.log(DomElement); \n\t{/*\n\t\t// logs the referenced element\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<h2>Hello, This is an element!</h2>\n\t\t</div>\n\t*/}\n}, []);\n\nreturn (\n\t<div ref={elementRef}>\n\t\t<h2>Hello, This is an element!</h2>\n\t</div>\n)}\n```\n\nthis way we can access all the JS DOM properties of the referenced element with the ref\n\n<br />\n\n\n### Example: focusing input with an Effect\n\nHow would you focus on the input field when the component mounts.\nA more good example would be animating the DOM element or start playing a video the first time you opened the site. for simplicity we'll go with focusing the inputs\n\n**Case 1**\n```tsx\n// I am using typescript here for better understanding \n\nimport { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction InputFocus() {\n  const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    inputRef.current?.focus();\n  },[])\n\n  return (\n    <input \n      ref={inputRef} \n      type=\"text\" \n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\nYou can just use \"Effects\" to achive this and it just works and you won't encounter any problems,\nleaving the dependency array empty is fine since refs are sneaky and won't notify updates. \n\nThe effect will run once \"on mount\" [twice in strict mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#ensuring-reusable-state). By that time, React has already populated the ref with the DOM node, so we can focus it.\n\n## Passing refs from ChildComponent to the ParentComponent\n\nWe cannot pass `Refs` directly from parent to child or vice-versa in Functional components unlike in Class Components.\n\nthere is a way to access a Ref of child Component in parent Component using `forwardRef`\n\n### Child Component\nimport {forwardRef} from \"react\";\n\n```tsx\nconst InputComp = forwardRef<HTMLInputElement>((props, ref) => {\n  return <input ref={ref} type=\"input\" />;\n});\n\n```\n\n### Parent Component\n\n```tsx\nimport {useEffect, useRef} from \"react\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (inputRef.current) {\n      inputRef.current.focus();\n    }\n  }, []);\n  return <InputComp ref={inputRef} />;\n}\n\n```\n\nWhen we wrap a component with `forwardRef` it's parent component can access it's refs\n\nusually `forwardRef` accepts `props` and `ref` as arguments\n\n- we update the ref passed by parent component in child component\n- now we have a reference to the child component ref in parent and we can utilize or manipulate it.\n- In our example we are focusing the `input` element of child component in the parent component using effects\n\n[Try the live demo by yourself](https://codesandbox.io/s/forwardref-typescript-5d6mhl?file=/src/App.tsx)\n\n\n##  Using refs in conditional rendering and loops\n\nIn the above example everything works fine but there are some advanced scenarios the above code won't work and, in some cases the Refs can get tricky to use\n\nRemember, in the above case what we were **assuming**\n>By that time the component mounts, React has already populated the ref with the DOM node, so we can focus it.\n\n<Image src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91829843/199696352-88f8b383-41bf-48b9-8e8f-b80c2221e655.png\" width=\"850px\" height=\"650px\" alt=\"React hooks lifecycle\" caption=\"React hooks lifecycle\" />\n[Source](https://wavez.github.io/react-hooks-lifecycle/)\n\n**If you see the lifecycle of hooks, `refs` are updated before we run the `useEffect()`**\n\nwe are assuming we already have the DOM node referenced by our ref and can access it by the time component mounts.\nthis is especially not good if we have some custom component where we are getting our ref from and decided to show the input after some other user interaction \nthe content of the ref will still be null when the effect runs and nothing will be focussed\n\nExample of this shown in case 2\n\n**Case 2**\n\n```tsx\nimport { useRef, useEffect, useState, forwardRef } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    {/* inputRef.current is null when it first runs */}\n    inputRef.current?.focus();\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <FormComponent ref={inputRef} />\n  );\n}\n\nconst FormComponent = forwardRef<HTMLInputElement>((props, ref) => {\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => setShow(true)}>\n        show\n      </button>\n      {/*  ref is attached to the input, but it's conditionally rendered\n       so it won't be filled when the above effect runs */}\n      {show && <input ref={ref} />}\n    </form>\n  );\n});\n\n```\n**In this example this is what happens:**\n\n- `FormComponent` renders \n- `input` element is not rendered as `show` is false and `ref` is still `null`\n- User clicks the show button\n- Effect runs, nothing happens as `inputRef` is still null\n- `input` renders and it gets referenced by `ref` now. but, will not get focused because effect won't run again.\n\nWe want to focus the `input` element \"right after it renders\" but not on the \"form component mount\".\n\nFor the `input` gets to focused effect has to run again which it won't\n\nHow can we achive this?\n\nthis is when our lord and saviour \"callback refs\" comes to rescue.\n\n## Callback refs\n\nif you look at the `ref` signature \n\n```tsx\ntype Ref<T> = RefCallback<T> | RefObject<T> | null\n```\n\nref can be a callback ref or the classic ref object with `.current` in it\n\n```tsx\n    interface RefObject<T> {\n        readonly current: T | null;\n    }\n```\n\ncallback refs give more control over how we access and update or do stuff with DOM nodes\n\nhere is how you can use callback refs\n```tsx\nconst FormWithCallbackRef = () => {\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => setShow(true)}>\n        show\n      </button>\n      \n      {show && (\n        <input\n          ref={(node: HTMLInputElement) => {\n            // you can see the type of node is: `HTMLInputElement` (advantages of using typescript 😉)\n            // we get reference to the DOM element inline \n            // and can access it's properties like shown below\n            node?.focus();\n          }}\n        />\n      )}\n    </form>\n  );\n};\n```\n[Try it the live demo by yourself](https://codesandbox.io/s/refs-1-5xseqg?file=/src/App.tsx)\n\nwe got the solution for update the element \"right after it renders\" not depending on the mercy of effects and re-renders\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Same thing with more examples</summary>\n\n  ```jsx showLineNumbers\n  import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\n\n  function InputFocus() {\n    const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n    const FocusElement = () => {\n      inputRef.current?.focus();\n      console.log(\"Focused\");\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <input \n        ref={inputRef} \n        type=\"text\" \n      />\n      <button onClick={FocusElement}>Focus</button>\n    );\n  }\n```\n\n**Here is what happens :** \n- Initially the `inputRef.current` is `null`\n- On the first render value of the ref will be set\n- On the button click `FocusElement()` function will be called\n- since we have already referenced the dom element `inputRef.current` value is our `input` DOM node.\n- `inputRef.current?.focus()` will be called resulting in focus\n\n</details>\n \n\n## Using refs in loops\n\nHow would you, right now, access multiple DOM elements \"with refs\" rendered within a loop (let's say `array.map((t) => (<div key={t}></div>)`)\n\nIf you say: \"With `useRef`\" you are wrong again.\n\nLet's say I have three videos and I want to get them all playing \"on mount\"\nThis might be the approach you'd go with:\n\n**Case 3.1**\n\n```tsx\n\nconst srcArray: string[] = [videoSrc1, videoSrc2, videoSrc3];\n\nconst AccessAndPlayAllVideosInLoop = () => {\n  const videoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    ref.current?.mute();\n    ref.current?.play();\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      {srcArray.map((src: string) => {\n        return (\n          <div key={src}>\n            <video ref={videoRef} src={src} />\n          </div>\n        );\n      })}\n    </form>\n  );\n};\n\n// Neither you can do this\n\nconst AccessAndPlayAllVideosInLoop = () => {\n  const videoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    ref.current?.mute();\n    ref.current?.play();\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      {srcArray.map((src: string) => {\n        return (\n          <div key={src}>\n            <video \n              // ❌ ESLint:\n              // React Hook \"useRef\" cannot be called inside a\n              // callback.  React Hooks must be called in a\n              // React function component or a custom React\n              // Hook function. (react-hooks/rules-of-hooks)\n                const ref = useRef()\n            src={src} />\n          </div>\n        );\n      })}\n    </form>\n  );\n};\n```\n**Here is what happens**\n- we map through all the video sources to render video elements\n- try to access the DOM node of each video with ref\n- ref value gets overridden by the next video element ref you render in the loop before you can play it\n- we'll end up referencing only the last video element we render \n- only the last video starts playing\n\n**a.** How can we access the rest of the video DOMs and play all of the videos?\n\n**b.** How can we give each of the video DOMs different DOM properties?\n\nfor 'a' you should know the answer by now, `Callback Refs`\n\n\nthis would be the proper way to do it\n\n**Case 3.2**\n```tsx\nconst srcArray: string[] = [videoSrc1, videoSrc2, videoSrc3];\n\nconst AccessAndPlayAllVideosInLoop = ({srcArray}) => {\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      {srcArray.map((src: string) => {\n        return (\n          <div key={src}>\n            <video ref={(node: HTMLVideoElement) => { \n              node?.mute(); \n              node?.play() \n            }} src={src} />\n          </div>\n        );\n      })}\n    </form>\n  );\n};\n\n// or you can do this way\n\nconst AccessAndPlayAllVideosInLoop = ({srcArray}) => {\n\n  function playAll(node: HTMLVideoElement){\n    node?.mute(); \n    node?.play() \n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      {srcArray.map((src: string) => {\n        return (\n          <div key={src}>\n            <video ref={(node: HTMLVideoElement) => { \n              playAll()\n            }} src={src} />\n          </div>\n        );\n      })}\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis is the problem I have personally encountered when making this site. If you see on the home page I have three videos, I rendered them within a loop. \nto control them individually, I have used `Callback Refs`\n\n### There is another solution for this\n\nAnother way to solve this is to create all the refs up-front and simply reference them in the loop:\n\n**Case 3.3**\n```tsx\nimport {createRef, useMemo, useEffect}\n\nconst srcArray = [\n  {\n    src: videoSrc1,\n    id: id1\n  },\n  {\n    src: videoSrc2,\n    id: id2\n  }, \n  {\n    src: videoSrc2,\n    id: id2\n  }\n];\n\nconst AccessAndPlayAllVideosInLoop = ({srcArray}) => {\n\n  const refsById = useMemo(() => {\n    const refs = {}\n\n    srcArray.forEach((item) => {\n        refs[item.id] = createRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null)\n    })\n    return refs\n  }, [srcArray])\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    refsById.map((video) => {\n      video.current?.mute()\n      video.current?.play()\n    })\n  },[])\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      {srcArray.map((item) => {\n        return (\n          <div key={item.id}>\n            <video ref={refsById[item.id]} src={item.src} />\n          </div>\n        );\n      })}\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Here is what we did here**\n- We have changed the structure of our source array as per our requirement that is to give them `IDs`\n- populated the `refsById` object with \"refs array\" with `createRef()` and filled the refs with `null` before-hand and memorised them so we won't re update the array unless `{srcArray}` changed\n- now we referenced each of the video DOM node with `refsById[item.id]` which is an array filled with ref objects we would get with `useRef` hook\n- now effects start running \n- we access the refs array on mount(ie., in useEffect) which has individual DOM nodes and manipulate the DOM as we need.\n\nPros of this approach than the Callback Refs is we can give each DOM node a different properties (eg. play the video 1,3 but pause video 2 \"on mount\")\n\nCons are we use extra memory space and we have to loop over everytime we wanna give all the DOM nodes the same properties\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Yet another way of doing the same</summary>\n\n Another way is to add refs to an array is by creating a `useRef([])`\n\n**Case 3.4**\n\n```tsx\n\n  import {createRef, useRef, useMemo, useEffect}\n\n  const srcArray = [\n    {\n      src: videoSrc1,\n      id: id1\n    },\n    {\n      src: videoSrc2,\n      id: id2\n    }, \n    {\n      src: videoSrc2,\n      id: id2\n    }\n  ];\n\n  const AccessAndPlayAllVideosInLoop = ({srcArray}) => {\n\n    const refArr = useRef([])\n\n    {/* refArr.current = srcArray.map((item, index) => {\n        return refArr.current[index] || React.createRef(null);\n    } */}\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n      refArr.current.map((video) => {\n        video.current?.mute()\n        video.current?.play()\n      })\n    },[])\n\n    return (\n      <form>\n        {srcArray.map((item, index) => {\n          return (\n            <div key={item.id}>\n              <video ref={refArr[index]} src={item.src} />\n            </div>\n          );\n        })}\n      </form>\n    );\n  }\n\n```\n\n**Here is what we did:**\n\n- we are using ref as a mutable storage variable here\n- created a ref array `refArray` using `useRef` hook (we don't have to bother about memorising them since refs are unaffected by re-renders)\n- map over the `srcArray` and fill the `refArray` with null refs or fill with pre-existing ref conditionally.\n- Access the refArray which has individual DOM nodes \"on mount\" (ie., in useEffect) and manipulate them as we need.\n\n</details>\n\n\n**Refs are double edged swords, they are as dangerous as powerful**\n\n",

      "raw": "\n\n**To be honest useReducer hook feels like unga bunga hook if you are using it for the first time, but this is simple uncluttered article to get familiar with useReducer hook. If you have used `useState` hook for managing the state like simple strings, arrays, objects you are going to have good time here. `useReducer` is used for this exact purpose that is for managing state. but it gives more flexibility for us to control and update the state.**\n\nAs a matter of fact useState is built on top of `useReducer` you can think of `useState` hook as a simplified version of `useReducer`**\n\n**let's see how to use `useReducer` hook first. then we will deep dive into this hook**\n\n```jsx {2-3,6-8} showLineNumbers\nconst  countReducer = (prevState, action) =>  {\n\tconsole.log(action)\n\t// logs whatever we passed in dispatch(/* smth */)\n\t// Ex: if we dispatch('bob') in <Counter />, output: 'bob'\n\t// if we do dispatch(1) in <Counter />, output: 1\n\treturn action // this value is our `newState` that reflects on `count` we get from useReducer\n}\n\nfunction  Counter({initialCount: 0}) {\n\tconst [count, dispatch] = useReducer(countReducer, initialCount)\n\n\treturn  <button  onClick={() =>  dispatch(count + 1)}>{count}</button>\n}\n```\n\n\nHere we just made a counter which we can increment on a button click.\n\n- We will get `[state, dispatch]` array from `useReducer`\n- `useReducer` takes _Reducer function_, _initial state_ as arguments\n- **Reducer function** accepts two arguments `reducerFn(previousState, action)` and returns `newState`\n\nYou have to focus on terms **state**, **dispatch**, **action**, **reducerFunction** here\n\n- **state:** _count_ is the state we want to manage here\n- **dispatch:** dispatch is a function through which we set the '**action** value' that we accept through our reducer function.\n- **action:** action is a value whatever we passed through function.\n- **reducerFunction:** it is a function through which we take control over and manage our state.\n\n## Flow example:\n\n1. Let's say we clicked the button which calls dispatch(count + 1)\n2. This dispatch value go through countReducer function where the new state will be returned.\n3. Now `action` value is equal to `count + 1` which is 0 + 1. (`action` = 1)\n4. We are returning the `action` value in the reducerFunction\n5. So our `<Counter />` will rerender because of our state is updated.\n6. Now useReducer gives `[count, dispatch]` array where, our count value has updated to`1`\n\n<Image src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91829843/187974612-2d1b0f0e-eedc-4312-998b-c24dfc65c7dd.png\" width=\"850px\" height=\"650px\" alt=\"React useDispatch hook lifecycle\" caption=\"React useDispatch hook lifecycle\" />\n\n**let's add some more things to our counter example with useReducer**\n\n```jsx showLineNumbers\nfunction countReducer(prevState, action) {\n const {type, step} = action\n switch (type) {\n   case 'increment': {\n     return {\n       count: prevState.count + step,\n     }}\n   case 'decrement': {\n     return {\n       count: prevState.count - step,\n     }}\n   default: {\n     throw new Error(`Unsupported action type: ${type}`)\n   }}\n}\n\nfunction Counter({initialCount = 0, step = 1}) {\n const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(countReducer, {\n   count: initialCount,\n })\n\n const {count} = state\n const increment = () => dispatch({type: 'increment', step})\n const decrement = () => dispatch({type: 'decrement', step})\n return {\n\t  <>\n\t  <h1>{count}</h1>\n\t  <button onClick={increment}>increment</button>\n\t  <button onClick={decrement}>decrement</button>\n\t  </>\n }\n}\n```\n\n[Here is the codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/still-firefly-d1jzc0?file=/src/Counter.js)\nIn this example, we are taking advantage of how `dispatch` and `action` work unlike the previous example.\nwhatever we give to the dispatch, the same will be reflected on `action` then we used switch case. if `action` is a particular value to do a particular operation. this is how most people use action, to navigate and tell what the reducer function should do to give us a new state.\n\nnow, I'm sure you got a good understanding of how useReducer works. Let's see some more examples and scenarios to learn more about this hook.\n\nLet's add an input field to our previous example..\n\nps: the following code has a bug! Can you spot where it is?\n\n```jsx showLineNumbers\nimport \"./styles.css\";\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nfunction countReducer(prevState, action) {\n\tconst { type, step } = action;\n\tconsole.log(prevState);\n\tswitch (type) {\n\t\tcase \"increment\": {\n\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\tcount: prevState.count + step,\n\t\t\t};\n\t\t}\n\t\tcase \"decrement\": {\n\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\tcount: prevState.count - step,\n\t\t\t};\n\t\t}\n\t\tcase \"usernameChange\": {\n\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\tusername: action.username,\n\t\t\t};\n\t\t}\n\t\tdefault: {\n\t\t\tthrow new Error(`Unsupported action type: ${type}`);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nexport default function Counter({ initialCount = 0, step = 1 }) {\n\tconst [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(countReducer, {\n\t\tcount: initialCount,\n\t\tusername: \"\",\n\t});\n\n\tconst { count, username } = state;\n\tconst increment = () => dispatch({ type: \"increment\", step });\n\tconst decrement = () => dispatch({ type: \"decrement\", step });\n\tconst handleChange = (event) => {\n\t\tdispatch({ type: \"usernameChange\", username: event.target.value });\n\t};\n\treturn (\n\t\t<div className=\"App\">\n\t\t\t<h1>{count}</h1>\n\t\t\t<button onClick={increment}>increment</button>\n\t\t\t<button onClick={decrement}>decrement</button>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<label>\n\t\t\t\t\tUsername:\n\t\t\t\t\t<input type={\"text\"} value={username} onChange={handleChange} />\n\t\t\t\t</label>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<h1> {username} </h1>\n\t\t</div>\n\t);\n}\n```\n\nhere we have added `username` to our state. now we can manage our state seamlessly\nbut hang on.. we have a bug in the above code.\nI did it intentionally to reach it in your core memory because it is a very common mistake people do.\nthe bug here is, whenever you change a state, for example take `increment` case\n\n```jsx showLineNumbers\n\tcase \"increment\": {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tcount: prevState.count + step\n\t\t}}\n```\n\nwe are esentially overriding the whole state with just count in the object. the new state will set to `{cont: prevState.count + step}` we loose our `username` state.\nThis is why we should spread the previous state in the object we are returning.\n**this is the correct way of doing it**\n\n```diff showLineNumbers\ncase \"increment\": {\n\treturn {\n+      ...prevState,\n\t\tcount: prevState.count + step\n\t}}\n```\n\nWe should always spread the previous state value in the return object. else we'll end up overriding bunch of other states.\n\n[Here is the codesandbox for this example](https://codesandbox.io/s/still-firefly-d1jzc0?file=/src/Counter2.js)\n\n**tip :** If you are managing similar state with the `useState` hook you can do like this\n\n```tsx showLineNumbers\nconst [countState, setCountState] = React.useState({ count: 0, name: \"\" });\nconst handleClick = () =>\n\tsetCountState((prevState) => {\n\t\treturn { ...prevState, count: prevState.count + 1 };\n\t});\n```\n\n\noh wait a min..\nif we can do this whole state thing simply using useState hook what's the point of using this complicated stuff?!!\nyeah right, you don't need to use this if useState can get the job done. most people make use of useReducer in codebases for the sake of maintainability, readability and to have better control over the state espicially in Forms.\n\n### When to use useReducer:\n\nit's wise to use useReducer when one element of your state relies on the value of another element of your state in order to update or when the state consists of more than primitive values, like nested object or arrays. if not, you are better off using `useState`\n\n## Tips:\n- Do not mix up and add lots of unrelated states into a single reducer.\n- whenever a single state changes you rerender the components which are using this state managed by reducer to get the whole state and UI updated.\n- Imagine one of the component that is so heavy to render and takes lots of resources and time and you re render it unnecessarly, the perfomance might degrade. <br /> This is why you should only put states which are interrelated together in a single reducer and make separate reducers in order to avoid unnecessary rerenders.\n",

      "raw": "\n\n**We often use fairly simple `useState` hook in our apps. sometimes using it might lead to some tiny performance issues. We'll go through some scenarios how to optimize perfomance with Lazy initialization of state in some scenarios. This article is a deep dive through our favorite `useState` hook.**\n\n`useState` hook can also accept a callback function. it can accept a state `T` or a Function that returns a state of type `T`. where `T` can be a String, Number, Array, or an Object.\n\n**This is the signature of useState hook.**\n\n```javascript\nfunction  useState<T>(initialState: T | (() =>  T)): [T, Dispatch<SetStateAction<T>>];\n```\n\n- `useState` hook is an abstraction of `useDispatch` hook of basic level.\n- You can think of `[state, setState]` as `[state, dispatch]` that we get from [`useReducer`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) where we modify the state using `dispatch` function, so `setState` is a simplified `dispatch` function.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Lazy Initialization of state\n\nReact useState hook can take a callback function as an initial value, this is called as lazy initialization of state.\n\nWhich means the return value of callback function going to set the state only once throughout the lifecycle of that component when the component mounts and rendered initially.\n\n```jsx\n  const [state, setState] =\n\tuseState<string>(() => {\n\t\tconsole.log(\"function call\"); // this will log for only once in the lifecycle of the component\n\t\tconst initialState: string = someExpensiveComputation(props);\n\t\treturn initialState;\n\t});\n// This is called as lazy initialization of state\n```\n### Tips:\n\n- Always remember to return the value of type you want to set the state for in the callback function, doing not so can lead to [uncontrolled components](https://codesandbox.io/s/dazzling-jones-b6w4q5?file=/src/ControlledUncontrolled.jsx) sometimes.\n- Lazy initialization of state is analogous to passing initial state through `useDispatch(reducerFn, initialValue)`\n- `useReducer` is usually preferable to `useState` when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values. It also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass `dispatch` down instead of callbacks.\n\nIt can be handy and performant when you are using custom hooks that utilize useState or when reading the state gets expensive.\n\nI can think of a scenario where reading the state can get expensive is when we are managing a state of browser localstorage value.\n\n```javascript\n// Here is a basic implementation of a custom hook for maintaining the state of localstorage value\n\nfunction useLocalStorageState(key, defaultValue = \"\") {\n\tconst [state, setState] = React.useState(() => {\n\t\t// We don't want to get our state value everytime from localstorage as it can take some time and lead to perfomance issues\n\t\tconst valueInLocalStorage = window.localStorage.getItem(key);\n\t\tif (valueInLocalStorage) {\n\t\t\treturn JSON.stringify(valueInLocalStorage);\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn typeof defaultValue === \"function\" ? defaultValue() : defaultValue;\n\t});\n\n\tReact.useEffect(() => {\n\t\twindow.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.parse(state));\n\t}, [key, state]);\n\treturn [state, setState];\n}\n```\n\nWhen we are calling this custom hook from other components like below, we don't want to set the initial value to `initialValue` everytime and override the localstorage value. _so setting the value lazily can get us out of this situation without overriding the localstorage value and it helps in increasing the performance of the app by saving calls to localstorage for the value._\n\n```javascript\nlet storage = useLocalStorageName(\"keyName\", initialValue);\n```\n\n## Storing a function with useState hook :\n\nYes, you heard it right. we can store a function with `useState` hook.\nbut merely passing a function to setState won't do this work. We should return a function to a callback function\n\n```jsx\nconst [myState, setMyState] = React.useState((x) => 5 * x);\n// this don't set the myState to a function, remember Lazy initialization. in fact it is illegal to pass arguments to callback function for useState.\n```\n\ndoing this will set the state to a function.\n\n```jsx\nconst [myState, setMyState] = React.useState(() => (x) => 5 * x);\n// this will set the myState to a function.\n```\n\nif you pass a function as a call back function and return it, the state will get initialized with a function.\n\n```jsx\n// Now we can use myState as a function\nlet value = myState(10);\nconsole.log(value);\n// output: 50\n\nconsole.log(myState(20));\n// output: 100\n```\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## How can we mutate a state hook with a function?\n\nJust like initialisation, passing a function to a state setter has a special meaning in React.\n\n[It is used when you want to compute the next state “reductively,”](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#functional-updates)\n\n```jsx\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);\nsetCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1); // increase the count by one\n// passing a function to setCount will result in updating the previous state value with return value of the function with previous state value as an argument.\n```\n\nif we intend to change the state which store function, doing this will update the\n\n```jsx\nsetMyState(() => (x) => 2 * x);\n```\n\nnow myState has updated to a new function we set\n\n```jsx\nmyState(10);\n// output: 20\n```\n\n\n\n<Warning type={'info'}>Although it is possible to store functions with useState hook don't abuse it, consider using useCallback hook for storing functions.</Warning>\n\n\n\\\n&nbsp;\n\\\n&nbsp;\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThere is a subtle difference how you store a state value and how you store a function with react useState hook. If you pass a callback function returning a value to the useState hook, state will be initialized for only for once with the value you are returning when the component mounts and rendered for the first time. It is called Lazy Initialization of state.\n\n```jsx\nconst [state, setState] = useState(() => {\n\tconsole.log(\"function call\"); // this will log for only once in the lifecycle of the component\n\treturn \"This is set for the first time\";\n});\n// This is called as lazy initialization of state\n```\n\nif you pass a function as a call back function and return it the state will get initialized with a function.\n\n```jsx\nconst [multiplyState, setMultiplyFn] = useState(() => (x) => 5 * x);\nconst product = multiplyState(10); // product is 50\n// Although it is possible to store functions with useState hook consider using useCallback hook for this purpose\n```\n\n```jsx\n// this won't store a function in the state\nconst [multiplyFn] = useState((x) => 3 * x);\nconst product = myMultiplier(10);\n```\n",
